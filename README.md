# Jira-Link App for Rocket.Chat

Jira Link is an app for Rocket.Chat to link Issues on your Jira Server autmatically, each time you mention the issue by its ID. It replaces the Issue ID with a markdown link and adds an attachment with the issue type, title and state to the message.

It is also possible to search for issues on the Jira Server using the `/searchjiraissue` slash-command. It will use the default Jira free text search.
